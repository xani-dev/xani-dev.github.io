### Hi, there!
Hi, I am Xani, and I am currently embarking on a new journey as a Full Stack Web Developer to expand my career as a Multimedia Engineer to the amazing world of Software Development by becoming a MERN full-stack dev. 

So far, my career path has built on me a dynamic blend of Digital Marketer and Program Manager in the Tech industry, I have always been curious about Software development, so, becoming a Web Developer feels like a natural next step to bring my career into another level. 

Always learning and looking for my next challenge, I am taking the leap and hoping this journey not only boosts my career but also Iâ€™m on a mission to inspire some other ladies around the globe, to truly believe they are capable of amazing things in the Software Development Universe.
