Yep, the world during the Pandemic has been a rollercoaster. It took everything we knew, shook it, and showed us a totally different world, and most importantly, it showed us what was really important to us.

And so, here we are, with our ideas renewed, with our souls refreshed and somehow humbled, and thatâ€™s all we need to get us a new start!

And yes, I went all-in for that, to explore new ideas, and jumped into a journey that was in my back-burner for a long time, and decided to start a career expansion from all things Digital Marketing and Multimedia to a full stack developer.

But first of all, let me introduce myself, I am Xani, a Mexican in tech, living in NYC. Oh, BTW, I absolutely loooooooove NYC and everything about the Big Apple!

By creating The Pink Dev, I wanted to create a place where I can document all the info, exercises, and resources I encounter along this new adventure, to see whatâ€™s possible and what is not.

But also, I wanted to create a little corner on the internet for people like you, who might be a bit curious about how a **Fullstack Developer** is born and the infinite realm of possibilities that come along with this decision.

I know that there wonâ€™t be a finish line and that it will take a full-size bag of focus, motivation, and tons of coffee, especially because jumping into Web Development as a woman, seems a bit daunting, but somehow it felt like the best career choice I have made, so, here I am, come along and letâ€™s see what happens. Hereâ€™s to new beginnings.
