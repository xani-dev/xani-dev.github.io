So, you have decided to jump into the coding and developing world but are not sure (yet) what a Fullstack Developer does and if that’s for you?

In short, a Full-Stack developer is a (cool) person who can build both **client-side** and **server-side** software.

Besides being a pro in the most basic stuff (**HTML** and **CSS**), this human will also capable of working on:

- •The **Browser** ( with Javascript, Angular, or any other browser-side technology).
- •The **Server** (with PHP, Phyton, Node, or any other server-side technology)
- •The **Databases** (maybe with SQL, Mongo, or any other database management technologies)

Basically, the Full-stack Dev is capable of working both, the Front-End and the Back-End, armed with the stack of their preference.

BTW, in case you are wondering, a stack is a combo of technologies targeted towards development. There are quite a few well-known stacks out there: MERN, MEAN, LAMP, MEVN, just to mention a few.

And with this, comes the adjective that can very well define a **Full-stack Developer**: versatility. And this is one of the reasons why Full-stack developers are in **high demand** nowadays.

Being a full-stack developer has many advantages:

- •You can master many techniques involved in a development project
- •You can make a prototype from scratch
- •You can help reducing costs
- •You’ll be able to manage Front-end and Back-End interchangeably
- •You will be able to communicate swiftly across multiple interdisciplinary teams.

So, if you love learning, if you love challenges, if you love having your plate full and being part of multiple layers of the projects you work with, the full-stack panorama will be very bright for you!

Guys, if you ask me, 2021, is a great time to become a **Full Stack Developer**.

If after reading all this, you are sold but don’t know where to start, here are a few tips:

- •Focus on mastering one stack first before jumping into learning new technologies. If you ask me, **MERN** is a great choice, because most of its technologies are free/open source and has been adopted by a great number of companies.
- •Learn how to debug!
- •Get familiar with [GitHub](https://github.com/) or any other form of version control.
- •Add an extra to stand out from the crowd: 
    +Learn Data Structures and Algorithms.

As for me, I am gearing towards the MERN stack, will then add some _Data Structures_ and _Algorithms_, practicing coding at least an hour per day, and then will spice things up by learning [GO](https://golang.org/).

Wish you the best of luck in your journey ✨ and please tell me, what do you think of the Full-stack developer panorama these days? 

Leave a comment, will love to hear from you!
