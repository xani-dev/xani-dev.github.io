# Github Portfolio Page

This project was created to illustrate the creation of a very basic Portfolio frontpage on Github for all new users of the platform interested in creating one. 

## But how?
It's really simple:
* Once you are logged into your new Github account, click on the "New Repository" button.
* Here's where the magic happens, we will create a "special" type of repository wich has to be named exactly as your user name. For instance, my user name is xani-dev, so my new Portfolio repository has to be named `xani-dev
/
xani-dev.github.io` 
  * :exclamation:
 *This naming  structure is very important, it is what will be displaying your creation as a Webpage* 
* Okay, now you have created your repository, let's upload your index.html file to it.
* If you haven't created it yet, do not panick, it is a very simple file with the following code: 
```html
<html>
  <h1>Your Name </h1>
  <img src="./YourPic.jpg"/>
</html>
```
  * :exclamation: *Make Sure your image path is correct, and also, make sure to upload both files, the html AND the image to your repository.* 

### `Let's commit`
* Once you have uploaded both files to your repository, click the `commit changes` button
* And voil√°, now you are ready to check your amazing creation. Go to: http://YourUserName.github.io and it will load automatically. 

Well done!
