**What do I need to learn first if I want to become a developer and I know nothing about coding?**

This is one of the most challenging questions to answer when starting a new journey, but when you decide to become a web developer and start asking Google what’s the best path to take to become a successful full-stack developer, the answers can be overwhelmingly hard to find.

So, here’s what I am doing, and I think it is a good start point if you are a complete beginner: **HTML and CSS**, these two guys are the most basic stuff you’ll have to master before jumping into the REAL programming languages such as Javascript, Ruby or any other you are interested in.

I have taken these classes back in Engineering school, but by now, everything that I learned was so outdated that I decided to take those topics as if I haven’t heard of those topics ever in my life.

HTML and CSS are the foundation of any web page, and you will find these two in basically every single web page you will ever visit in your life.

[Lynda.com](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/), [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/basic-html-and-html5/), and [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp) are good places to find high-quality info about these topics.

So, go ahead, try to find a blog/ book/ video or whatever-format suits you best to learn these two guys, at least in the most basic sense, so you can have a solid foundation to advance this journey to the next level.

Wishing you the best of luck!
